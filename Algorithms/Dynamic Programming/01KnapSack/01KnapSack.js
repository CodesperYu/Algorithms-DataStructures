/*  Given weights and values of n items, put these 
 items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the
 knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] 
 which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also 
 given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset 
 of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break 
 an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
